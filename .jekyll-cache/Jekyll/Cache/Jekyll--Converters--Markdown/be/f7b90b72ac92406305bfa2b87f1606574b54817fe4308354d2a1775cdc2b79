I"é<p>Our teamâ€™s design challenge was to create a public-interest technology (PIT) tool that would support librarians in their quotidien work through knowledge sharing. Through our initial conversations with librarians at the Queens Public Library , the Miami-Dade Public Library System , and other public libraries in the United States, we primarily considered how we might help librarians make exceptions to rules when needed for high-need groups. The scope of our PIT tool focuses on creating a tool that would redirect the day-to-day labor of librarians who are tasked with assisting patrons toward a more permanent resource that could continuously serve as a form of knowledge sharing, as opposed to fleeting and temporary interactions.</p>
