            We are a group of students and faculty working to design, build, and deploy technology that serves the public. We are a part of the inaugural class of <a href= "https://www.newamerica.org/pit/">New America's Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN)</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Our mission is to develop design practices that help technologists design for the public.
            Technology for the private sector is often designed with the <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond">double diamond design process</a>.  Although this has been successful at making consumer goods, designing for the public is a broader problem with the potential to deepen existing inequities in society. For example, deciding to designing for people with a personal computer biases products towards wealthier users. 
            We are working to understand how the design process can be altered to be inclusive of the public. Our current tool is the PIT Design Process.  
            </p>

            <img src="/images/cu-pit-dd-blue.png" style="width: 100%" alt="the public interest technology (PIT) double diamond process">
            </p>
            <p>
                In this process has two distinct differences from the traditional design process:
                <ol>
                    <li>At every stage of design, there are critical questions to make user the process covers the full range of the public. </li>
                    <li>The process places greater emphasis on (a) research and engagement phases and (b) the prototyping and testing phases. For PIT, it takes more time to understand the full extent of the problem and to evaluate it with users who may be hard to reach or whose trust may take time to earn.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                We develop and teach these practices though courses and independent projects. Examples of projects from Fall 2020 are below.

            <div class="project-text"><p>Our team’s design challenge was to create a public-interest technology (PIT) tool that would support librarians in their quotidien work through knowledge sharing. Through our initial conversations with librarians at the Queens Public Library , the Miami-Dade Public Library System , and other public libraries in the United States, we primarily considered how we might help librarians make exceptions to rules when needed for high-need groups. The scope of our PIT tool focuses on creating a tool that would redirect the day-to-day labor of librarians who are tasked with assisting patrons toward a more permanent resource that could continuously serve as a form of knowledge sharing, as opposed to fleeting and temporary interactions.</p>

<p>Community members and visitors to Clearfork are able to share, preserve and explore the history and culture of Clearfork on a local network with easily navigable functionality.

The application provides a simplified, customized checklist so users can see exactly which documents they are required to gather and submit when applying for citizenship and keep track of them. To generate the checklist, the application first asks a series of simple (yes or no) questions to ensure the user is eligible for naturalization, then another set of simple (yes or no) questions about their life circumstances. Based on the user’s answers, the application will generate the appropriate list of documents for the customized checklist which is produced after the questions are answered.</p>

Livingston Manor only has one newsroom and one library, so it’s both a news and library desert. The town’s only newspaper is run by two adults and five high school students. Today, news and knowledge about the town is captured and recorded only by this grassroots newsroom.</p>

<p>Our solution, “Palimpsest”, introduces a prototype that encourages communities to share their moments and their local history. The act of sharing memories allows for connections to be drawn between community members and creates a sense of belonging and unity within the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Their responsibility to capture and preserve community knowledge, prompts our question: How might we help Livingston Manor record
and engage with their shared history so that
community members have a greater sense of
identity, belonging, and unity?</p>
