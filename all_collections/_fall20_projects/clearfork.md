Clearfork Valley is currently mitigating the institutional impacts of the long, exploitative history of the mining industry. Despite many challenges, Clearfork remains resilient with a thriving Appalachian culture and hope in the potential of reliable internet access.

The community has improved access to internet through newly installed Portable Network Kits. This new design not only supports existing community efforts, but also expands on the off-grid applications available on the PNK through an improved user interface and new archiving platform.

Community members and visitors to Clearfork are able to share, preserve and explore the history and culture of Clearfork on a local network with easily navigable functionality. The updates to the PNK is a mechanism for empowerment, that looks “beyond the goal of simply connecting people to the internet.”
