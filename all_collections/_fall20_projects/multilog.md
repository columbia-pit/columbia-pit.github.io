A progressive web application that is designed to decentralize the prevalence of English as the default language for most website development. Given a large population of the Queen’s Public Library (QPL) patrons do not speak English very well and are often bilingual or multilingual, Multi-log treats all languages equally by curating content based on the user's language preference. The goal is to ensure the user experience for all is maintained regardless of the user’s known language, enabling non-English speakers (especially immigrants) to fully utilize QPL’s services.
