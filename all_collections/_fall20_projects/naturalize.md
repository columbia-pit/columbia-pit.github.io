Naturalize addresses a common problem we came across in our research and interviews: the naturalization process is filled with complicated paperwork and requires applicants to submit various documents, which can be overwhelming and confusing, especially because every applicant has unique circumstances which may call for different, additional documents.
The application provides a simplified, customized checklist so users can see exactly which documents they are required to gather and submit when applying for citizenship and keep track of them. To generate the checklist, the application first asks a series of simple (yes or no) questions to ensure the user is eligible for naturalization, then another set of simple (yes or no) questions about their life circumstances. Based on the userâ€™s answers, the application will generate the appropriate list of documents for the customized checklist which is produced after the questions are answered.
