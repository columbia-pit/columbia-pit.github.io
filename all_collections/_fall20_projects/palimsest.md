Livingston Manor, a small town on the edge of the Catskill Mountains with just over 1,233 residents in 2018 serves as our case study for this project. Livingston Manor only has one newsroom and one library, so it’s both a news and library desert. The town’s only newspaper is run by two adults and five high school students. Today, news and knowledge about the town is captured and recorded only by this grassroots newsroom.

Our solution, "Palimpsest", introduces a prototype that encourages communities to share their moments and their local history. The act of sharing memories allows for connections to be drawn between community members and creates a sense of belonging and unity within the neighborhood.

Their responsibility to capture and preserve community knowledge, prompts our question: How might we help Livingston Manor record
and engage with their shared history so that
community members have a greater sense of
identity, belonging, and unity?
