            We are a group of students and faculty working to design, build, and deploy technology that serves the public. We are a part of the inaugural class of <a href= "https://www.newamerica.org/pit/">New America's Public Interest Technology University Network (PIT-UN)</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Our mission is to develop design practices that help technologists design for the public.
            Technology for the private sector is often designed with the <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/what-framework-innovation-design-councils-evolved-double-diamond">double diamond design process</a>.  Although this has been successful at making consumer goods, designing for the public is a broader problem with the potential to deepen existing inequities in society. For example, deciding to designing for people with a personal computer biases products towards wealthier users. 
            We are working to understand how the design process can be altered to be inclusive of the public. Our current tool is the PIT Design Process.

                In this process has two distinct differences from the traditional design process:
                <ol>
                    <li>At every stage of design, there are critical questions to make user the process covers the full range of the public. </li>
                    <li>The process places greater emphasis on (a) research and engagement phases and (b) the prototyping and testing phases. For PIT, it takes more time to understand the full extent of the problem and to evaluate it with users who may be hard to reach or whos trust is not easy earn.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                We develop and teach these practices though courses and independent projects. All our teaching materials are public on the <a href="">Courses</a> page. Please use or adapt anything that is useful to you. Attribution to http://columbia-pit.com is appreciated.
